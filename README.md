# Object-detection-using-Yolov3

Weight files are too large to be uploaded on Github.
So use this linkðŸ‘‰ https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ and download respective weights.

The code is majorly from Murtaza Hassan(just search and you will find him easily on Github as of 2022) but made some corrections like index error and all.

Thankyou and Happy CodingðŸ¤˜
